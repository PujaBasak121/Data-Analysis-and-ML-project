## Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML is used in various applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, speech recognition, etc.

### Key Concepts:

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Overfitting and Underfitting
